To install and run an application locally using the steps you provided, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

2. Install `mdbook`:
   `mdbook` is a Rust-based utility for building books using Markdown. To install `mdbook`, follow the steps below:

   a. Ensure that Rust and Cargo are installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can follow the official Rust installation instructions: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

   b. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install `mdbook`:
      ```bash
      cargo install mdbook
      ```

3. Serve the Application on localhost:
   Once `mdbook` is installed, navigate to the cloned repository's directory using the terminal or command prompt.

   a. Run the following command to serve the application locally:
      ```bash
      mdbook serve --open
      ```
      This command starts a local web server and automatically opens your default web browser to preview the application.

   b. The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address. The actual port number may vary depending on the configuration.

   c. You can now view and interact with the application in your web browser. Any changes made to the Markdown files will automatically trigger a rebuild, and the web page will refresh to reflect the updates.

That's it! You have successfully installed and run the application on your local host using `mdbook`.
